## üî¨ Introduction

### Background and Motivation

Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals contain unique biometric information that can be used for both patient identification and secure data transmission in healthcare systems. Traditional encryption methods often rely on external keys that can be compromised or lost. Our research addresses this limitation by developing a system that generates encryption keys directly from the ECG signal characteristics, ensuring both security and usability.

2. **Implement chaotic encryption algorithms** with adaptive parameters
3. **Integrate machine learning** for parameter optimization
4. **Evaluate security performance** against various attack vectors
5. **Create a real-time processing system** for practical applications

### 2. Biometric Key Generation

#### Chaotic Parameter Derivation
```
r = r_base + Œ±‚ÇÅ √ó mean + Œ±‚ÇÇ √ó std + Œ±‚ÇÉ √ó entropy
x‚ÇÄ = x‚ÇÄ_base + Œ≤‚ÇÅ √ó entropy + Œ≤‚ÇÇ √ó peak_count + Œ≤‚ÇÉ √ó frequency
```

Where:
- `r`: Chaotic parameter (typically 3.847 for logistic map)

- **Entropy Distribution**: Validates randomness of generated keys
- **Key Space Analysis**: Measures cryptographic strength

### 3. Encryption Process

#### Chaotic Sequence Generation
```python
def logistic_map(x0, r, n):
    sequence = np.zeros(n)
    x = x0
    for i in range(n):
        x = r * x * (1 - x)
        sequence[i] = x
    return sequence
```

#### Encryption Steps
